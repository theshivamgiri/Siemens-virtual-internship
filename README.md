## Siemens Mobility Project Manager Simulation â€“ Forage (August 2025)

This repository showcases my completed job simulation for the **Siemens Mobility Project Manager Virtual Experience** hosted on **Forage** in August 2025. The experience provided a hands-on introduction to real-world project management scenarios in the rail and mobility sector, with a focus on **KPI development**, **dashboard creation**, and **stakeholder communication**.

As part of the simulation, I was tasked with managing a rail infrastructure project from a project managerâ€™s perspective. The core focus areas included:

* **Establishing Strategic KPIs**: I identified, defined, and applied relevant key performance indicators aligned with Siemens Mobilityâ€™s broader business objectives. These KPIs supported project tracking in areas such as schedule adherence, budget management, safety metrics, and stakeholder satisfaction.

* **Dashboard Development and Data Visualization**: Using **Microsoft Excel**, I created a dynamic project dashboard that communicated essential project metrics. This dashboard helped visualize project health and supported data-driven decision-making. I utilized formatting, charts, and formula-driven logic to create clear, accessible views for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

* **Problem Solving in Real-World Scenarios**: The simulation presented realistic challenges such as construction delays, conflicting stakeholder feedback, and shifting project priorities. I applied adaptive strategies to maintain momentum, proposed data-supported solutions, and ensured consistent communication with internal and external teams.

* **Stakeholder Engagement**: A key part of the experience was tailoring updates and project insights for diverse audiences. I practiced structuring reports and dashboards that could be shared with senior leadership, engineers, and municipal partners, ensuring transparency and alignment across project stages.

This project highlights my capability in **project planning, analytical thinking, data-driven decision-making, and stakeholder management** â€” all critical skills for a project management role in engineering, infrastructure, or mobility sectors.
